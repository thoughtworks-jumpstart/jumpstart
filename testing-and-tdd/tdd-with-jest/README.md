# TDD with Jest

Code along template: [https://github.com/thoughtworks-jumpstart/jest-starter-template](https://github.com/thoughtworks-jumpstart/jest-starter-template)

## Testing libraries

Here are the commonly used JavaScript test runner libraries: `jest`, `jasmine`, `mocha`. They are very similar in their functionality and API design, so if you master one, chances are - learning the others won't be difficult.

In this chapter, we will learn `jest` because:

* `jest` has feature-parity with other test runners \(e.g. `mocha`, `jasmine`\)
* `jest` is fast
* minimal configuration is required
* the snapshot testing feature \(which we will use later when we learn React\)
