# After getting started

You're nearing the end of the course, but you're just getting started! This is an exciting journey of continuous learning, challenge and growth.

It is easy to get stuck in the 'getting started' phase \(it doesn't help that the number of 'getting started' tutorials is so much more than the 'getting good' or 'master X' tutorials\). So it's important that you deliberately practice getting good at your craft.

## Keep on learning

### Learning how to learn effectively

* You can spend some time to learn [how to learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) or [how to read a book](https://www.amazon.com/How-Read-Book-Classic-Intelligent/dp/0671212095)
* Need to pick up a new programming language? There is a [fast way](http://www.flyingmachinestudios.com/programming/learn-programming-languages-efficiently/) although eventually it takes you [10 years](http://norvig.com/21-days.html) to be good at it.
* Don't just read. Get your hands dirty.
* You are capable to do 80% tasks by learning 20% of a new skill in [the first 20 hours](https://first20hours.com/)
* Staying up-to-date as a software developer with [a daily learning routine](https://trevordmiller.com/blog/learning-routine)
* Don't stay in your [comfortable zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comfort_zone). Always put yourself in learning zone.
* Make good use of your time. Have 15 mins free? You can learn something new in that 15 mins.

### Keep yourself updated with latest technology news
