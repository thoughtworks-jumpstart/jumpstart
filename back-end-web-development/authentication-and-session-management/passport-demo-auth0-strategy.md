# Passport Demo: Auth0 Strategy

So far we have been issuing JWT tokens by ourselves. We actually can offload that duty to another service provider called [Auth0](https://auth0.com/).

There is a passport strategy for [auth0](https://github.com/auth0/passport-auth0) which allow us to obtain JWT tokens from this provider and use it for our authentication.

Follow [this tutorial](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/webapp/nodejs/01-login) to learn how to use Auth0.
