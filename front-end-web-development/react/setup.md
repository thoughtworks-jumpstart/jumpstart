# Setup

## Creating a react project with `create-react-app`

`create-react-app` is a commandline tool that helps us take care of the configuration of react applications so that we can focus on writing code, rather than configuration. It also takes care of the bundling of JSX and ES6 syntax into ES5 javascript which any browser can support. `create-react-app` vastly simplifies the creation and deployment of React applications, and is useful for getting started with React.

* Docs: [https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
* How to create a react app:
  * `cd your-workspace-folder`
  * `npx create-react-app my-awesome-app`
    * 'my-awesome-app' folder will be created under 'your-workspace-folder'.
  * `cd my-awesome-app`
  * `npm run start` or `yarn start`.
    * This command will start a [webpack dev server](https://survivejs.com/webpack/developing/webpack-dev-server/) that serves your application. You can visit your React application at http://localhost:3000
