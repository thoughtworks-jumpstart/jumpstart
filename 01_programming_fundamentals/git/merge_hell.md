# Merge hell

If and when we don't follow the practice of (i) committing often and (ii) push often on the master branch (a.k.a. trunk-based development), we can land ourselves in merge hell. 

Merge hell is a sticky place and getting out of it can be painful and time-consuming (it can take hours or even days). Instead of building your application, now you have to spend time tearing your hair out!
